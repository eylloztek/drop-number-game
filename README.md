# Drop Number Game

## Introduction

Drop Number Game is a fun and engaging puzzle game developed in Java, utilizing a multi-linked list data structure for efficient game state management. The game challenges players to combine tiles with matching numbers to create larger values on a 7x5 grid. The objective is to score as high as possible before the grid fills up and no more moves are available. This game works on a given scenario.

## How to Play

**Starting the Game:** The game begins with an empty 7x5 grid.

**Playing the Game:** Each turn, a player slides a numbered tile onto the grid from the top. Tiles can only move downwards.

**Combining Tiles:** If two tiles with the same number collide, they merge into a single tile with double the value. For example, two tiles with "2" will merge into a "4".

**Objective:** Keep combining tiles to form larger numbers and prevent the grid from filling up.

**Game Over:** The game ends when there are no more moves left, meaning at least one of the columns is completely filled.
